# pepeScreper - 4chan scraper  <img src="./assets/4chan-logo.png" style="height: 20px; width: 20px; margin: 0 0 0 5px">

*A complete scraper for 4chan (I don't guarantee it will be fast)*

pepeScraper is a scraper that uses context for your searches and returns exactly what you want. *(I'm learning how to make an item look cooler than it actually is)*

- Enter keywords, anything you can think of *(just be careful what you search for 👀)*
- Control the results by date and exclude what you don't want to appear.
- Control the search speed of this program *(do not confuse the processing thread with the 4chan thread)*

## installation

If you use Windows, just go to releases and download the latest version and then install the dependencies. *If you want to help and have access to the source code, use the code below.*

```bash
    git clone https://JuaanReis/pepeScreper.git
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you use Linux it will also be the same thing above (but Linux sometimes forces you to use that damn venv) so use the code below.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JuaanReis/pepeScreper.git
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Flags

```
    "--key <w>": keywords used as the base for search and scraping  
    "--thread <n>": 4chan thread where the posts are located  
    "--exclude <w>": keywords to be excluded from the results  
    "--date <YYYY/MM/DD>": exact date when the OP post was made  
    "--before <YYYY/MM/DD>": posts before the given date up to today  
    "--after <YYYY/MM/DD>": posts after the given date up to today  
    "--min-replies <n>": minimum number of replies the thread must have  
    "--max-replies <n>": maximum number of replies the thread can have

```

## Beware of NFSW content

> *I'm serious, pornography can destroy your brain (no matter how much I write this you'll ignore it)*

```bash
    python main.py --keyword "pepe" --exclude "nsfw" --date 2025-01-01
```
*This can make your research perhaps safer (I don't know if I programmed this right).*
